Simple interface used for exploring non-local, 2 party refereed games.

Games can be created (randomly, or from known paramaters), and non-local
strategies can be found with linear programming.

This is all very rough, hacked together, and intended to be used only by me.
However, if anyone stumbles across this and finds it useful, please let me know!
